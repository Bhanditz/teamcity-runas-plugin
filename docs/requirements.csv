#;Description;Source;Type;
1;Let's allow to configure (properties seem to be almost ideal for this) username/password of the account under whom the build should run;TW-3171;;
2;Agent should give full access to the user over the build working directory and start the build process under the user.;TW-3172;;
3;Ensuring the user has only the necessary OS permisisons is a task of agent machine administrator.;TW-3173;;
4;It might be necessary to limit permissions for a user agent runs under, but run a build with another user.;TW-3174;;
5;The solution should be platform-specific (runas on Windows and sudo on Linux?);TW-3175;;
6;Need to ensure each project is delimited from others for security reasons;TW-3176;;
7;Certain users in TeamCity might have a permission to run the build process under elevated permissions user on the agent (e.g. to perform signing).;TW-3177;;
8;Extend "run" dialog to specify the credentials to run the build under specific user.;TW-3178;;
9;This feature is applicable to use with DB (test);TW-3179;;
10;It should work correct via local and domain users;TW-3180;;
11;Ability to run  elevated admin application;TW-3181;;
12;We could use a generic build account instead but weâ€™d much prefer it if we could pass the credentials the user is currently using to authenticate to Team City to the Powershell script without hardcoding any passwords;TW-3182;;
13;We should pass almost all environment variables excepting like these: appdata, localappdata, userdomain, username, userprofile;Yegor;;
13;This plugin should work when an agent is running as a console app and as a service;Yegor;;
14;ExitCode, StdOut and ErrorOut should be transparently redirected to TeamCity;Yegor;;
15;RunAs tool could be used as a standalone tool;Yegor;;
16;User should be able to define a whole command line in simplest way using this tool;Yegor;;
17;The password should not be disclosed (in the case of using under TeamCity);Nikolay;Security;
18;parameter should be read from build parameters, not only agent's parameters;TW-3182;;
19;password for the command should be hidden by default. Would be better to pass via environment variable (TBD how passing other password parameters matches with necessity to generate environment for the launched process);TW-3182;;
20;there should be logging in the build log on the usage of the feature;TW-3182;;
21;We just want to run build steps processes under runAs, we are not using it to start processes like vcs sources checkout, artifact downloading, results processing, etc.;Yegor;Scope;
22;Now we are implementing it for windows agents only;Pavel;Scope;
23;"User should have an ability to select ""runAs"" account for a project level and for a step level";TW-3182;UI;
24;"Administrative UI provides an ability to create a list of users (Id, UserName, Password) including the current agent's account (""Default"") to use in the projects/steps";Nikolay;UI, Admin;
25;"Administrative UI provides an ability to grant the following options:
- to select a subset of users which can be used in projects,
- the privilege to filter a set of project
- the privilege to change ""runAs"" account";Nikolay;UI, Admin;
26;"Project level ""runAs"" UI provides an ability
- to filter a subset of users which applicable here and for childrent projects/steps, if it is allowed by admin or in the parent projects
- to change ""runAs"" account, if it is allowed by admin or in the parent projects";Nikolay;UI, Project level;
27;"Step level ""runAs"" UI provides an ability to change ""runAs"" account, if it is allowed by admin or in the parent projects";Nikolay;UI, Step level;
28;A project produces a requirement to check capability of agents - a set of user names;Nikolay;Capabilities;
29;An agent produces a a set of supported user names according to some by reg expression to filter user names or according to the configuration parameter;Nikolay;Capabilities;
